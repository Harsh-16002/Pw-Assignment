        "Qualitative data, also known as categorical data, describes characteristics or qualities and is often non-numeric. This type of data captures descriptions rather than measurements.

If we add another score, say 100, the ordered list is now 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100. The median is now the average of the two middle values: Median = (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Random sampling is a fundamental concept in statistics that involves selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population, where every individual has an equal chance of being chosen. This method is crucial in making inferences about populations, as it provides a basis for drawing reliable and unbiased conclusions about the whole population from the characteristics of the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of Random Sampling in Making Inferences:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Ensures Representativeness: Random sampling increases the likelihood that the sample accurately represents the entire population. This representativeness is essential because it means that the characteristics (e.g., mean, variance) of the sample are likely to reflect those of the population, allowing us to generalize findings from the sample to the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reduces Bias: By giving each individual an equal chance of selection, random sampling minimizes the potential for selection bias, which occurs when certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in the sample. This unbiased approach is critical for making valid inferences, as a biased sample could lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Allows for Generalization: Random sampling enables us to infer population characteristics from sample statistics. For example, if we measure the average income in a random sample of households, we can use this statistic to estimate the average income of the entire population, with a known level of confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Enables the Use of Probability Theory: Random sampling allows us to apply probability theory and statistical methods to make inferences. For example, we can calculate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests on the sample data to estimate population parameters (like means or proportions) and test hypotheses about the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Helps Estimate Sampling Error: Random sampling allows us to measure sampling error, the difference between the sample statistic and the true population parameter. Sampling error decreases as the sample size increases, and random sampling provides a basis to calculate this error, giving us a way to understand the reliability of our inferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Random Sampling:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Simple Random Sampling: Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is typically done by assigning numbers to each individual and using a random number generator.\n",
        "\n",

In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, such as a normal distribution, the data is evenly spread around the mean, and the distribution has zero skewness. However, in most real-world data, the distribution is often not perfectly symmetrical, and skewness helps to describe the extent and direction of this asymmetry.\n",
