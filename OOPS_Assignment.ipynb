        "Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a data structure by bundling attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class. It represents real-world entities and encapsulates data and behavior defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that manipulate the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components, promoting controlled access via public methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: The process by which a class (subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (superclass), allowing for code reuse and creating hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object that is calling them, typically achieved through method overriding and overloading.\n",
